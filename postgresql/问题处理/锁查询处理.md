## 系统视图
- pg_class
  存储了数据库中每个表、索引、视图、序列等对象的元数据  
  relkind：对象的类型。  
  常见值包括：  
  r：常规表（普通表）  
  i：索引  
  S：序列  
  v：视图  
  t：TOAST 表  
  m：物化视图  
- pg_locks
 显示当前 PostgreSQL 数据库中所有锁的信息。包含锁的状态、持有者以及锁的类型
- pg_stat_activity
  显示每个正在运行的查询及其状态
  
### 查询当前锁
```
SELECT
    pg_class.relname AS object_name,
    pg_stat_activity.datname AS database_name,
    pg_stat_activity.usename AS user_name,
    pg_stat_activity.pid AS pid,
    pg_stat_activity.query AS query,
    pg_locks.locktype AS lock_type,
    pg_locks.mode AS lock_mode,
    pg_locks.granted AS lock_granted,
    pg_stat_activity.state AS state,
    pg_stat_activity.query_start AS query_start,
    pg_stat_activity.wait_event_type AS wait_event_type,
    pg_stat_activity.wait_event AS wait_event
FROM
    pg_locks
JOIN
    pg_stat_activity ON pg_locks.pid = pg_stat_activity.pid
JOIN 
    pg_class ON pg_locks.relation=pg_class.oid
WHERE 
   pg_stat_activity.state <> 'idle' 
ORDER BY
    pg_stat_activity.query_start
```
### 查询表的行级锁
```
-- 安装扩展
  CREATE EXTENSION pgrowlocks;

-- 查询锁
SELECT *
FROM users AS a,
     pgrowlocks('users') AS p
  WHERE p.locked_row = a.ctid;
```

### 终止锁进程
```
SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid);
```
